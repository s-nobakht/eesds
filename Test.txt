An information dispersal algorithm is a method to split a file f into n pieces in such a way that the file can be reconstructed from some predefined subsets of pieces. Information dispersal algorithms have different applications, as secure and reliable information storage, fault-tolerant and efficient transmission of information in distributed systems, and communications between processors in parallel computers.

Information dispersal algorithms were first considered by Rabin. He proposed algorithms to split a file into n pieces in such a way that the file can be reconstructed by any m pieces, where m\leq n. Beguin and Cresti considered a more general situation: they showed how to realize an information dispersal algorithm for any access structure, where the access structure is the family of all subsets of pieces that are able to reconstruct the file.

In this paper we use an information theoretical framework to describe multiple information dispersal algorithms, i.e., algorithms for splitting more than one file into the same set of pieces. The efficiency of any information dispersal algorithm is computed regarding the size of the pieces. For any tuple of access structures, we show a combinatorial condition on these structures that is sufficient to obtain pieces of a certain size. For specific pairs of access structures of particular interest, namely, structures realizing alternate chains, we show tight bounds on the size of the pieces.
